# TypeScript Everyday Types Lesson

This project walks through the **Everyday Types** section of the official TypeScript documentation using terminal-based testing (`Node.js` + `console.log()`).

We cover:
- Primitive types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`
- Arrays (`type[]`)
- Union types with narrowing (`typeof`)
- Type aliases
- Interfaces
- Optional properties (`?`) and optional chaining
- Interface extension and inheritance
- Type assertions (commented out to avoid runtime errors in Node)
- Literal types and return types (`"left"` | `"right"` | `-1` | `0` | `1`)

Each section is clearly numbered in `index.ts` with logic-based examples and comments written in my own words.
